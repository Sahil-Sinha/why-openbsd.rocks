title: "carp(4)"

The `carp` interface is a pseudo-device which implements and controls 
the CARP protocol. `carp` allows multiple hosts on the same local
network to share a set of IP addresses. Its primary purpose is to
ensure that these addresses are always available, but in some
configurations `carp` can also provide load balancing functionality.

Details:

* The `carp` device first appeared in [OpenBSD 3.5](https://openbsd.org/35.html).
