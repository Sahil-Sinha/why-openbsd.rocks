title: "openrsync"
---

In early 2019 OpenBSD imported `openrsync` to the base system as a free and
open alternative to traditional `rsync`.

`openrsync` has a reduced, simplified set of features, an acceptable
[license](/fact/license/) (BSD) while still being compatible with `rsync`.

Details:

* the `openrsync` program first appeared in [OpenBSD 6.5](https://openbsd.org/65.html). 
* [OpenBSD on Tweet about openrsync](https://twitter.com/openbsd/status/1094750961107697664?s=21)
