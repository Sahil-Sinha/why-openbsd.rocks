The `rpki-client` utility queries the RPKI repository system with 
openrsync(1) to fetch all X.509 certificates, manifests, and
revocation lists under a given Trust Anchor.

`rpki-client` subsequently validates each Route Origin Authorization 
(ROA) by constructing and verifying a certification path for the
certificate associated with the ROA (including checking relevant
CRLs). `rpki-client` produces lists of the Validated ROA Payloads
(VRPs) in various formats.
