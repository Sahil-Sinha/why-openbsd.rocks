`perl` - The Perl 5 language interpreter

`Perl` officially stands for Practical Extraction and Report Language,
except when it doesn't.

`Perl` was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary 
text files, extracting information from those text files, and
printing reports based on that information. It quickly became a
good language for many system management tasks. Over the years,
`Perl` has grown into a general-purpose programming language. It's
widely used for everything from quick "one-liners" to full-scale
application development.

The `Perl` motto is "There's more than one way to do it." Divining
how many more is left as an exercise to the reader.

The three principal virtues of a programmer are Laziness, Impatience,
and Hubris. See the [Camel Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Perl) for why.
