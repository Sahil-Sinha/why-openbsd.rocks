`tmux`, created by Nicholas Marriott, is an in-base, BSD licensed terminal multiplexer.
It enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a
single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the
background, then later reattached.

There is also a portable version of tmux for non-OpenBSD machines.
