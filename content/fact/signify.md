title: "signify(1)"

`signify` is a small and elegant tool to cryptographically sign and verify
files. It was created to sign OpenBSD releases, since OpenBSD 5.5, and
Binary Patches for [syspatch](/fact/syspatch). It uses only the
Ed25519 algorithm.

Think of it as an simple, easy replacement for PGP signing.
