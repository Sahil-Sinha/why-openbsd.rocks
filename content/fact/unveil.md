title: "unveil(2)"
---

The `unveil` system call limits the filesystem `open` call to a
given set of paths. It extends the idea of [pledge](/fact/pledge/):
simply limiting programs to `open` is insufficient, because `open` is valid
for the the whole filesystem.

For example, why should a program like [`passwd(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/passwd.1)
have access to your file system beyond `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`?
 If there is a security bug in `passwd` then effects would be quite limited.

The function first appeared in OpenBSD 6.4.
