title: "cron(8)"
---

OpenBSDâ€™s cron(8) daemon can randomize values (`~`), and prevent multiple jobs
from running concurrently (`-s`). Super useful additions that all cron
implementations should have had forever.

> For example "0~30" will result in a random value between 0 and 30
> inclusive.  If either (or both) of the numbers on either side of the '~'
> are omitted, the appropriate limit (low or high) for the field will be
> used.

Example:

```
0~30 1 * * * [-nsq] echo foo
```
