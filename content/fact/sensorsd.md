`sensorsd` â€” hardware sensors monitor

The `sensorsd` utility retrieves sensor monitoring data like fan
speed, temperature, voltage and RAID logical disk status from the
[sysctl(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2) hw.sensors subtree. When the state of any monitored sensor
changes, an alert is triggered. Every alert logs a message to
[syslog(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/syslog.3) using the __daemon__ facility. Optionally, an alert can be
configured to execute a command.

Details:

* The `sensorsd` program first appeared in [OpenBSD 3.5](https://openbsd.org/35.html).
* [sensorsd(8) - OpenBSD manual pages](http://man.openbsd.org/sensorsd.8)
